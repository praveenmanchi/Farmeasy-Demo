## Breaking Barriers to Precision Agriculture

Access to reliable power has traditionally been a major barrier for farms wanting to implement IoT monitoring systems. **FarmEasy's** new solar-powered nodes are changing that equation, enabling precision agriculture in the most remote locations.

### Key Innovation

- 100% solar-powered operation with 14-day battery backup
- No electrical infrastructure required
- Operates in extreme temperatures (-20°F to 140°F)
- Cellular connectivity with satellite backup option

## Real-World Impact

> "We have fields 5 miles from the nearest power line. Before FarmEasy's solar nodes, monitoring those areas was impossible. Now we have real-time data from every corner of our operation."

— _Robert Chen, Farm Operations Manager, Oregon_

## Technical Advantages

Each solar node features:

- High-efficiency monocrystalline panels (30W)
- Industrial-grade lithium battery system
- Multi-sensor capability (up to 8 sensors per node)
- Weatherproof IP67-rated enclosure
- 10-year expected lifespan

## Expanding Access

FarmEasy's solar-powered solution is particularly valuable for:

- Organic farms with dispersed plots
- Rangeland and pasture monitoring
- Developing regions without grid access
- Environmentally sensitive areas
- Temporary monitoring applications

With over 2,000 solar nodes deployed across North America, FarmEasy is proving that sustainable, off-grid precision agriculture is not just possible—it's practical and profitable.
