David Kim is a senior data scientist specializing in machine learning applications for agriculture. His algorithms help farmers predict crop yields, detect diseases early, and optimize resource allocation based on historical patterns and real-time sensor data.

## AI for Agriculture

David's work transforms raw farm data into predictive insights. His models analyze years of sensor readings, weather patterns, and crop performance to forecast outcomes and recommend optimal farming practices.

## Technical Expertise

- Deep learning for satellite and drone imagery analysis
- Ensemble models for yield forecasting (92% accuracy)
- Natural language processing for agricultural knowledge extraction
- Real-time anomaly detection in sensor streams
- Edge computing optimization for farm deployments

## Research Contributions

- Published 8 papers on agricultural machine learning
- Developed open-source tools for farm data analysis
- Presented at NeurIPS Workshop on AI for Agriculture
- Patent holder for crop disease prediction system

## Beyond Data Science

David is passionate about making AI accessible to farmers and regularly conducts workshops explaining machine learning concepts in practical, non-technical terms.
