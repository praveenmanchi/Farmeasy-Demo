## About the Role

We're seeking an experienced Director of Product Management to shape the future of precision agriculture technology at FarmEasy. This senior role offers the opportunity to define product strategy, work closely with farmers, and lead a world-class product team.

## What You'll Do

Own the product roadmap from strategy through execution. Spend time on farms understanding real challenges, translate those insights into product requirements, and guide engineering teams to build solutions that delight customers. Balance competing priorities and make data-driven decisions about feature development.

## Ideal Background

Strong product management experience in B2B SaaS or IoT, with passion for agriculture and sustainability. You understand how to build products that solve real problems, not just implement requested features. Agricultural experience is a plus but not required—we'll teach you about farming if you bring excellent product skills.

## Why Join FarmEasy?

Lead product innovation at a mission-driven company making real environmental impact. Significant equity upside, collaborative culture, and opportunity to shape how farms operate worldwide. Work alongside talented engineers, agronomists, and data scientists building the future of agriculture.
