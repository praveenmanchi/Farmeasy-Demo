**Sacramento, CA – October 20, 2024** – FarmEasy today announced the launch of its "Growing Together" grant program, aimed at providing free precision agriculture technology and training to small-scale and beginning farmers across the United States.

## Program Overview

- **Technology Grants**: Free sensor systems and one year of platform access for qualifying farms
- **Training & Support**: Comprehensive onboarding, training, and ongoing agronomic support
- **Eligibility Focus**: Small farms (under 100 acres), beginning farmers (farming < 10 years), and underserved farming communities
- **Partnership Network**: Collaboration with agricultural extension services, farmer cooperatives, and community organizations

"Precision agriculture shouldn't be available only to large commercial operations," said CEO Jennifer Martinez. "Through this initiative, we're ensuring that small and beginning farmers have access to the same technology and agronomic insights that help larger farms succeed sustainably."

The Growing Together program will provide complete sensor installations, including soil moisture monitors, weather stations, and analytics dashboards, to 100 qualifying farms in 2025.

Applications are now open through March 31, 2025. Priority will be given to:
- Beginning farmers and ranchers (USDA definition)
- Socially disadvantaged farmers
- Organic and sustainable agriculture practitioners
- Farms in water-stressed regions
- Veterans transitioning to agriculture
