## Farm Overview

Sunrise Dairy Farm operates a 500-cow dairy operation in Wisconsin, producing 4 million gallons of milk annually. Feed represents 55% of their operating costs, making feed quality and waste management critical to profitability.

## Challenge

The farm faced significant feed management issues:

- Frequent feed spoilage due to moisture intrusion
- Inconsistent feed quality affecting milk production
- Labor-intensive manual quality checks
- Temperature fluctuations in storage silos
- Difficulty tracking feed inventory
- $60,000 annual losses from spoiled feed

## Solution Deployed

We implemented an integrated feed monitoring system:

- Temperature and humidity sensors in all 6 silos
- Automated ventilation control systems
- Load cells for precise inventory tracking
- Mobile alerts for out-of-range conditions
- Historical data analytics dashboard
- Predictive maintenance alerts

## Implementation Timeline

### Initial Assessment (Week 1)
- Audited existing feed storage infrastructure
- Installed baseline monitoring equipment
- Measured spoilage rates and patterns

### System Installation (Weeks 2-3)
- Deployed solar-powered sensor nodes
- Installed automated ventilation controls
- Set up inventory tracking system
- Configured mobile alert system

### Optimization (Weeks 4-6)
- Fine-tuned temperature/humidity thresholds
- Established automated response protocols
- Trained staff on dashboard usage
- Created standard operating procedures

## Results Achieved

The system delivered immediate and sustained benefits:

- **40% reduction** in feed spoilage
- **$24,000 annual savings** from reduced waste
- **3% improvement** in milk production
- **85% reduction** in manual monitoring time
- **99.5% system uptime**
- **12-month ROI** payback period

## Operational Improvements

### Feed Quality Control
- Real-time moisture monitoring prevented mold growth
- Temperature alerts enabled rapid intervention
- Consistent feed quality improved herd health
- Reduced veterinary costs

### Inventory Management
- Precise feed level tracking
- Automated reorder alerts
- Better supplier negotiations with usage data
- Reduced carrying costs

### Labor Efficiency
- Eliminated manual silo climbs (safety improvement)
- Reduced daily monitoring from 2 hours to 15 minutes
- Staff redeployed to higher-value tasks
- Remote monitoring during off-hours

## Financial Impact

- **Direct savings**: $24,000/year from reduced spoilage
- **Indirect savings**: $8,000/year from improved milk quality
- **Labor savings**: $12,000/year
- **Total annual benefit**: $44,000
- **System cost**: $36,000
- **Payback period**: 9.8 months

## Environmental Benefits

- Reduced methane from spoiled feed decomposition
- Lower carbon footprint from decreased feed waste
- Improved water efficiency through better herd health
- Reduced need for replacement feed shipments

## Manager Testimonial

"Before FarmEasy, we were climbing silos twice daily to check temperatures and hoping we'd catch problems before feed spoiled. Now the system alerts us immediately if anything's wrong. We've eliminated almost half our feed waste and the cows are producing more milk on better-quality feed. The ROI was even faster than promised."

## Technical Details

The system includes:
- 18 environmental sensors (3 per silo)
- 6 automated ventilation controllers
- 6 load cell systems for weight tracking
- Solar power with 7-day battery backup
- 4G cellular connectivity
- Cloud-based data analytics

## Lessons Learned

Key success factors:

- Importance of proper sensor calibration
- Value of automated response systems
- Staff training critical for adoption
- Regular maintenance prevents false alerts
- Historical data enables continuous improvement

## Future Expansion

Sunrise Dairy plans to expand the system:

- Add commodity barn monitoring
- Integrate with TMR mixer for recipe optimization
- Connect to herd management software
- Implement predictive analytics for feed purchasing
